# hitch

Hitch is a ride-sharing application for long distance carpools. Do you need to get from one city to another, but don't want to pay for a flight or Greyhound? Hitch provides users with the ability to search for rides on your trip date and join up with a driver and other passengers who are leaving from and going to the same place as you.
